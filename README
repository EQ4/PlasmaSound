Plasma Sound
------------

This Android App is essentially a theremin/continuum/keyboard for Android, powered by PureData, in the form of LibPD, as well as Processing.  The background is MSAFluid, optimized for Android.


Building
--------

So you want to build Plasma Sound? It's pretty easy.

get pd-for-android:
https://github.com/libpd/pd-for-android

get my multitouch android library:
https://github.com/rjmarsan/AndroidProcessingMultitouch

add them to eclipse
add Plasma Sound to eclipse, and re-add them as library projects.

That should be it.



License
-------

Plasma Sound's source code is BSD licensed (as is libpd, msafluid).  
However, all the artwork, and the name Plasma Sound, is copywritten RJ Marsan, 2012 (I'm just a little afraid of someone repackaging my app for profit, etc.)
