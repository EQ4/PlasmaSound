Plasma Sound is now the most fully-featured and 100% free music instrument on the Android Marketplace!

Beautiful music instrument inspired by the Theremin, Continuum, Keyboard and Sequencer.  Touch the screen and a note is generated.  It's X-Axis (left-to-right) is pitch, which is designated by note and octave markings.   It's Y-Axis (up-and-down) is up to you to control!  Plasma Sound is incredibly configurable. Pick the note range, the waveform, cutoff, delay, tremolo, vibrato and more!  You can even select between continuous mode (theremin-like), quantize mode (keyboard-like), and a hybrid.

Plasma Sound applies the same principals to the Sequencer to give you even more music creation abilities!  Select a note to activate it, and drag up and down to select it's Y-value, controlling the same thing that the Y-Axis controls in the Keyboard section.  Immediately you get an incredibly dynamic and versatile sequencer.

On top of all that is a beautiful visual based off of MSAFluid, The sound is generated by libpd.







I definitely want to stress that it's free.  Not like... free but plastered with ads, or a free demo, but super freaking free.

The source link is a nice thing to have on there, but if it's not easy to put in, it has no place.  It's not a 'feature' of the app, but if there's an easy place to 'tuck it away' that'd be nice.
